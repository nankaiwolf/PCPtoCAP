Abstract: 

Background: To analysis the metagenomic characteristics of lower respiratory tract of pneumocystic pneumonia (PCP) patients.

Methods: We recruited 6 PCP patients confirmed by PCR and microscopic examination, as PCP group, and 6 community acquired pneumonia (CAP) patients as CAP group in our critical care department, from November, 2019, to April, 2021. We extracted DNA from the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) of the two groups, and applied the next generation sequencing and bioinformatic analysis. The data of non-normal distribution were shown as median (quartile deviation), and P-value ＜0.05 was considered to be statistically significant.

Results: 6 patients in PCP group (5 males) had the age of 68(9.0) year-old, while 6 patients in CAP group (4 males) had the age of 67(26.3) year-old, and the differences had no statistically significance (P＞0.05). All patients in PCP group had long-time application of corticosteroid for underlying diseases (prednisone ≥20 mg/day, ≥2 months), including dermatomyositis, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, Evans Syndrome, radiation pneumonia (for the treatment of esophageal cancer), ANCA associated vasculitis, and lymphoma. Shannon index of PCP and CAP groups were 4.1(0.53) versus 3.6(1.35) (P＝0.18), and Pielou index were 0.55(0.052) versus 0.47(0.165) (P＝0.48), and the differences had no statistically significance. The PCoA demonstrated no statistically significant difference between these groups (P＝0.22). The dominant phylum in PCP and CAP group was proteobacteria (53.5(22.90)% versus 43.4(45.14)%, P＜0.05). Alphaproteobacteria (P＝0.010), Crenarchaeota (P＝0.009), Thermoprotei (P＝0.009), Sulfolobales (P＝0.009), Caulobacterales (P＝0.037), Rhodospirillales (P＝0.016), Selenomonadales (P＝0.036), Legionellales (P＝0.037), Haloferacales (P＝0.020), Chloroflexi (P＝0.009), and Cardiobacteriales (P＝0.022) were enriched in PCP group by LEFSe analysis. The expression of K03257 (translation initiation factor 4A), K02937 (large subunit ribosomal protein L7e), K02951 (small subunit ribosomal protein S12e) were increased in PCP (P-values were 0.044, 0.044, and 0.024, respectively), while the expression of K03283 (heat shock 70kDa protein), K04282 (thyrotropin-releasing hormone receptor), K09441 (GA-binding protein transcription factor, alpha), K08517 (vesicle transport protein SEC22), K12877 (protein mago nashi), K07949 (ADP-ribosylation factor-like protein 5A), and K03462 (nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase) were decreased (P values were 0.029, 0.034, 0.046, 0.048, 0.006, 0.018, and 0.046, respectively).

Conclusion: The dominant phylum of lower respiratory tract of PCP was proteobacteria, and there were also multiple enriched classes and orders. However, the diversity between PCP and CAP had no significant differences. The increased and decreased ontologies may suggest some potential mechanisms of PCP pathogenesis.
